<div id="about_me">


	<p>
		I was born and raised in Haiti.I was enrolled at Boyd Anderson High for 2 years. I than transferred to a private school for the remainder of my schooling. After graduation, I wanted to learn programing, however, due to financial issues I wasn't able to afford it. I than decided to find a job in retail. I worked for Gordon Food Services (GFS)  for 3 years. During my time there, I started as a customer rep and was quickly promoted to team leader. I left GFS and started working at Sport Authority for a year. There I heard about Wyncode. As soon as I heard about Wyncode, I started saving money in attempt to afford it. I was fortunate enough to obtain a full scholarship. I than left retail to focus on my education. I am now, happily, a student at Wyncode. I have learned a lot! Of the many things that I've learned are:  html, css, ruby, and ruby on rails.
